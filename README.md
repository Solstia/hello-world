Hello, my name is Batuhan Solim. You can call me Sol. I am as of writing this 22 years old, living in Savannah, GA attending the Armstrong campus for Georgia Southern University for Computer Science. I enjoy working out, engaging with new media, and learning more about my Turkish heritage and culture! I hope that in my future with coding I can find a career that allows me to exercise the creativity that this field has to offer. 
- Now 5 months later, I return with more promising dedication and desire for the craft and hope to have used the time spent well
